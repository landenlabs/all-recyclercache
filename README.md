## Sample app to measure RecyclerView cache management. 

This Android app demonstrates how <b>ViewType</b> impacts the caching and reuse of ViewHolders.

    In-depth understanding of the caching mechanisum of Android RecyclerView by xiangzhihong (July-2021)</a>



The RecyclerView is populated with two different item types to demonstrate different layouts:
- Planet 
- Map 

The controls at the top of the screen control how the RecyclerView is filled. 
- Checkbox  "Unique View Type" controls whether the <b>ViewType</b> value is unique for all items 
or returns one of two values associated with the two card types.
- Radio buttons  "Select List Size" control how many items are placed in RecyclerView. 
Changing the list size causes a new list to be created, adapter to be rebuilt and attached to 
the RecyclerView and <b>java garbage collector</b> to be called. 

Status is displayed at the bottom of screen under the RecyclerView
- Created = Number of <b>ViewHolder</b> instances created (called constructor)
- Memory = Number of <b>ViewHolder</b> instances active in memory (in view or cached)
- Attach = Number of <b>ViewHolders</b> currently attached to screen (in view).
- List size = Number of <b>items</b> in list passed to Adapter passed to RecyclerView
- Cache Map/Planet - shows the number of items per <b>ViewType</b> in the RecyclerView pool cache. 
 The RecyclerView has two caches, this is only one of them. See [reference documents linked at the top.](#Some-related-articles)
- Memmory Stress = additional list of strings, one allocated every minute to apply
some stress on the memory system.  Not sure if this makes any difference.

## ViewType per card type (cache small, good reuse)

Example shows ViewType set to card type for each of the two possible cards (Map or Planet), 
allowing the <b>RecyclerView</b> to reuse <b>ViewHolders</b> which go out of view. 
List is populated with 50 semi-random items of two types ("planets" and "map" cards)
Status on the bottom shows 20 ViewHolders created, 15 in memory and 6 attached to view.  
There are 6 cards in full view and the RecyclerView is caching 9 additional (6+9=15 viewholders in memory)

Values appear after selecting 50 items and scrolling through entire list a few times. 
The interesting (puzzling) is why did the RecyclerView create 20 items, when there at most about 6 items in view and only two layout types. 

The RecyclerView default cache pool size is 2. See [reference documents linked at the top.](#Some-related-articles)

## ViewType unique per row (caching all items, no reuse)

The ViewType returns a unique value for every item, resulting in no reuse and 
every item created as you scroll with all items kept in memory. 50 items = 50 in memory. 
Nothing is reused, but constructors only called once per item.

<hr>

## Short list (5 items, all in view) all items cached, no reuse.

When the RecyclerView does not have to scroll because all items are in view, then every ViewHolder is created once. 
There is no reuse and ViewType has no impact on memory savings.
